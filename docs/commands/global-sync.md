# `sync-agents global sync`

Fan the user's global `~/.agents/` tree out to per-tool global
directories — `~/.claude/`, `~/.codeium/`, `~/.cursor/`,
`~/.github/copilot/`, `~/.codex/` — using semantic-aware routing.

## Synopsis

```text
sync-agents global sync [--targets t1,t2] [--dry-run] [--force] [--global-root PATH]
```

## What it does

For every artifact under `~/.agents/{rules,skills,workflows}/` and
every registered tool, the sync:

1. **Resolves the artifact's semantic** (`invocable` or `passive`)
   via YAML frontmatter or, when absent, the bucket default. See
   [Semantic routing](../architecture/semantic-routing.md).
2. **Resolves the per-tool destination** for that (semantic, tool)
   pair using the routing table in SPEC-002.
3. **Performs the appropriate filesystem operation**:
   - Per-artifact **symlink** (Claude, Cursor, Windsurf invocables)
   - Append to a **concat batch** (Windsurf passive, Copilot, Codex)
   - **Skip with warning** (multi-file invocable skills targeting
     Windsurf workflows; passive skill dirs targeting Claude)
4. **Regenerates concat targets** at the end — one atomic
   tmp+rename write per concat file. If the new content equals the
   existing content (byte-identical), the file is left alone
   preserving its mtime.

## Per-tool routing reference

| Tool | Invocable destination | Passive destination |
|---|---|---|
| `claude` | `~/.claude/skills/<name>/SKILL.md` (skill) or `~/.claude/commands/<name>.md` (rule/workflow) | `~/.claude/rules/<name>.md` |
| `codeium` | `~/.codeium/windsurf/global_workflows/<name>.md` (single-file only) | concat → `~/.codeium/windsurf/memories/global_rules.md` |
| `cursor` | `~/.cursor/rules/<name>.md` | `~/.cursor/rules/<name>.md` (same — Cursor doesn't distinguish) |
| `copilot` | concat → `~/.github/copilot/instructions.md` | same concat |
| `codex` | concat → `~/.codex/instructions.md` | same concat |

Skipped cases:

- **Multi-file invocable skill → Codeium**: Windsurf workflows are
  single `.md` files, so a skill dir with `SKILL.md` plus supporting
  files can't be a workflow without flattening. Skipped for codeium
  only with a warning; the skill still syncs to other tools.
- **Passive skill → Claude**: a directory marked `invocable: false`
  has no clean Claude destination (Claude's passive surface is a
  single `rules/*.md` file). Skipped with a warning. Decide whether
  to split the skill into rules or accept the gap.

## Idempotency

Re-running `global sync` on an unchanged tree:

- **Symlinks** that already point at the canonical artifact are
  left alone.
- **Symlinks** that point at a different (or broken) target are
  silently repaired and logged as `[repair]`.
- **Concat files** whose newly-computed content byte-equals the
  existing content are not rewritten — `mtime` is preserved so
  external watchers don't fire spuriously.

If everything is current, the command exits 0 with summary lines
like `… already current (N entries)`.

## Conflicts

If a **non-symlink** file or directory exists at a per-tool symlink
destination, the sync refuses to overwrite it without `--force`. The
warning names the path so you can investigate.

With `--force`, the conflicting file is moved to
`<path>.replaced-by-sync-agents` (so it's recoverable) before the
fresh symlink is placed.

Concat files don't go through the conflict check — they're
sync-agents-owned by design. Any user edits to a generated concat
will be overwritten on the next sync; that's why the banner says
"do not edit by hand."

## Flags

| Flag | Default | Effect |
|---|---|---|
| `--targets <list>` | all | Comma-separated tool IDs to sync. Aliases honored: `windsurf` resolves to `codeium`. Unknown names produce a warning and are skipped. |
| `--dry-run` | false | Print every planned operation prefixed with `[dry-run]`. No filesystem writes. |
| `--force` | false | Replace non-symlink files in the way (saved as `*.replaced-by-sync-agents`). |
| `--global-root <path>` | `$HOME/.agents` | Override the global root. See [Global root resolution](../architecture/global-root-resolution.md). |

`--dry-run` and `--force` are persistent flags inherited from `rootCmd`.

## Examples

```bash
# Standard sync of everything.
sync-agents global sync

# Only sync Claude and Cursor.
sync-agents global sync --targets claude,cursor

# Windsurf alias works.
sync-agents global sync --targets windsurf

# Preview without writing.
sync-agents global sync --dry-run

# Use a temp root (test rig).
sync-agents global sync --global-root /tmp/.agents

# Compose with promote in one shot.
sync-agents promote rule security --sync
```

## Promote-and-sync composition

`sync-agents promote ... --sync` runs `global sync` immediately after
a successful promote. Use `--sync-targets <list>` on the `promote`
command to limit which tools are synced in that follow-up:

```bash
# Promote a rule and immediately fan it out to just Claude.
sync-agents promote rule security --sync --sync-targets claude
```

When `--sync` is omitted, `--sync-targets` is ignored.

## Exit codes

- `0` on success or a clean dry-run. Skipped artifacts produce
  warnings but do not change the exit code.
- non-zero if `~/.agents/` doesn't exist (run `global init`) or if
  a filesystem error halts the whole sync (rare).

Per-tool failures (concat regen error, symlink creation error)
produce warnings but do not abort the run — partial progress is
preferable to all-or-nothing for fan-out operations.

## What `global sync` does NOT do

- It does not pull artifacts from upstream repos — that's
  [SPEC-003](../../specs/SPEC-003-source-manifest-pull.md).
- It does not regenerate per-project sync targets (the local
  `.claude/`, `.windsurf/`, etc.). Use the existing `sync-agents
  sync` command for project scope.
- It does not modify or delete content inside `~/.agents/`. The
  canonical tree is read-only from sync's perspective.
